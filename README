This is a perl module that uses a Trie (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie for a better description) for efficient storage of DNS domain names, with a hashref bucket of storage at the end of the key.


Below is an example list of domain names, and how they're stored in the trie, presented in beautiful YAML form.
